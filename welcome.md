# Python Data Structures Final Project

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Final Project! This project is designed to help you learn about various Python data structures:

* [Queues]()
* [Sets]()
* [Trees]()

We will go over each of the data structures in it's corresponding file. Each module teaches you about the data structure as well as gives you a example problem to solve at the bottom. Each file also contains a solution to the example problem that you can look at once you complete the problem.
